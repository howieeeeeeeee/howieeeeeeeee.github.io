<!-- While Sandy Cheeks is a squirrel, some would argue she is humanoid enough to selectively breed. Human evolution has reached its peak and we must enact to further our species into a new age; what is that age you must ask? The ice age. 
  Inevitably, a cold ice age will reset this world and with squirrel genes in our pool - much like Scrat from Ice Age, Ice Age: The Meltdown, Ice Age: The Great Escape, 
  Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, Ice Age: A Continental Drift, and Ice Age: Colission Course - we can preserve through peak selective advantages of the Nut. 
  Nutritional value like no other, the nut contains superior protein content than that of meat. Another series of evidence on why squirrels are inherently fuckable is the close relative Theodore from Alvin and The Chipmunks. 
  Through all media containing Theodore, he has only gotten thicker and thirstier; his Cheeks are busting through my screen begging me to claim them. Although his pristine, angelic voice could just be a siren leading me to my demise, 
  I have taken the liberty of plunging into the darkness for my fellow man. In conclusion, Theodore and Sandy Cheeks were the catalysts to my adaptation into Sigmahood. Through rigorous testing in silken sheets the glimpse of light for 
  humanity has erected like the flames of Gondor. Cast away morals and become stronger, faster, and lose yourself between some soft, bristly thighs.. less we succumb and fall to our former selves -->
